# DIP-Project (Digital Image Processing)

Welcome to our Digital Image Processing tool ‚Äî a comprehensive desktop application designed to demonstrate and apply key image processing techniques in an interactive and user-friendly way.

## üìñ About the Project

This project was created as part of our final-term requirement in the Digital Image Processing course.  
The main goal was to implement a wide range of fundamental and advanced image processing techniques and bring them together in a single, interactive graphical user interface (GUI).

The tool allows users to:
- Load and display images.
- Apply point and neighborhood operations.
- Perform histogram analysis and enhancement.
- Add and restore noise using different filters.
- Segment images using thresholding.
- Detect edges and extract boundaries.
- Visualize results clearly using subplots.

The entire application was built using Python with libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and the GUI was designed using Tkinter.
